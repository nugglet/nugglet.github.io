## About Me

Hello, I'm Miles (nugglet). Welcome to my personal blog, where I post about tech-related issues I am interested in.
I graduated from college with a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Design, with a minor in Artificial Intelligence. I find modern technology fascinating, and I am always seeking out new knowledge in a wide variety of technological domains. My primary interests lie within Artificial Intelligence, with a particular focus in Computer Vision techologies. As an avid gamer, I am also greatly intrigued by graphics technology. 

In this blog, I hope to cover the following topics:
* Artificial Intelligence
  * Statistical Machine Learning
  * Deep Learning
  * Computer Vision
  * Reinforcement Learning
   * MLOps
* Software Engineering
  * Front/Back-End
  * DevOps
  * Software Testing
* Graphics and Visualisation

Of course, this list is not exhaustive, and as I am a person of Many (sadly) hobbies and interests, the contents of this blog may or may not be subject to change.

This blog serves to consolidate my learnings. Thank you for reading and I hope that you find my notes useful in some way.
