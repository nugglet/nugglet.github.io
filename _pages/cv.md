<sub>See my github for more information</sub>

[Reinforcement Learning for Splendor Board Game](https://github.com/omnifarter/50.021-Splendor-AI/tree/feat/rl_model)
July 22 – Aug 22
  * Designed and iterated on an AI model to play the board game Splendor using Deep Q Learning.
  * Designed the model’s environment, actions, simplified problem, and game logic.
  * Assisted in creation of a graphical user interface in React.js for the MinMax Algorithm.

[Research in Object Detection and Classification for Sketch Images](https://github.com/nugglet/50.035-CV-Project/)
Jan 22 – Apr 22
  * Investigate methods to increase image classification with greater shape bias using image augmentation techniques (i.e. 
Gaussian Blur, Gaussian Noise, Colour Distortion)
  * Implemented CNN models with transfer learning from ResNet-50 and AlexNet in PyTorch
  * Trained and tested on the ImageNet-Sketch Dataset with inference testing on a custom dataset of our own hand-drawn 
sketches.

[MBTI Personality Multi-Label Classification using NLP Techniques on Social Media Posts](https://github.com/nugglet/MBTI-Personality-Classification)
Aug 21 – Dec 21
  * Investigated various machine learning and deep learning models for MBTI classification of a collection of social media 
posts from the [Kaggle MBTI dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/mbti-type) to predict the personality of the authors
• Prototyped and implemented of various model architectures (i.e. Traditional ML, LSTM, BERT) using PyTorch and Keras
• Evaluated on a classification report of AUROC, Precision, Recall and F1 scores. The BERT model returned the best results

[Discord Bot Development for Investigation on Network Architectures](https://github.com/nugglet/Discord-Networks-Project)
Aug 21 – Dec 21
  *      Researched and developed a testing methodology to measure the VOIP call quality of Discord’s voice channels
  *      Conducted experiments using two Discord bots to send and record audio respectively, created in Node.js
  *      Recorded, assessed, and compared the VOIP quality using the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) using packet loss, latency and 
jitter data obtained with Wireshark
